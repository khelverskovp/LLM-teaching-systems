 principle is that we say we have seen some data, we want to find the model that maximizes the probability of seeing this data. And of course there's other principles, learning principles, such like Bayesian inference principle, we'll touch a little bit about that throughout the course, but mainly we'll be concerned with maximum likelihood base methods, with regularization, which is like a poor man's version of Bayesian inference. Okay, so how do we actually, for this classification?
