 put and one up. So it's all scalars and we have only two weights. So we can start by saying, okay, we have a cost function. It would depend on both the weight in the second layer and weight in the first layer. So let's try first to take the derivative with respect to the weight in the second layer. And immediately we see that this, the cost function depends only implicitly on the weights because it depends only explicit, it depends explicitly on the activation.
