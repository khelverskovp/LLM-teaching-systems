 of the second layer. So we can use the chain rule of differentiation. So that we say we take the first derivative, when we want to take the derivative back to the weight, we take first the derivative, back to the activation in the second layer and then we take the derivative of the weight with respect to this activation. So that gives us this expression here for the derivative. And we can play the same game for the
