 problem, the M-ness problem, how do we actually formulate this as a maximum likelihood problem. We can do that by using what is called one-hot encoding. This will lead to the so-called cross entropy likelihood function. And one-hot encoding is this idea that we actually take our class and make that into a sparse vector, which has the same dimensionality as a number of classes. So in this case, with M-ness, we have 10 classes. So we can see if the
