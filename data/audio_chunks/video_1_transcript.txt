 So in the next task, before we are ready to run here, it's actually to understand how we train these networks. And this will become the famous backpropagation algorithm. And the backpropagation algorithm is nothing, but a gradient, it's to cast a gradient descent algorithm. But before we can talk about what's about gradient descent, we have to understand what is the cost function. And the basic point here is that the cost function we're working with is kind of connects to normal statistics because it's the...
