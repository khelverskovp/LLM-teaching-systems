 the cost function only depends on the activations in the last layer and the weights in the third layer depends on this activation through kind of the relo and through the softmax and then this kind of weight times the input from the previous layer. But now if we go to the second layer you can see we have to use chain rule and we get a summation where we have to sum over all the inputs and if we go to the first layer we get both the summation over all the inputs.
