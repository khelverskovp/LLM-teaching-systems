 as minus the log likelihood for such a classification problem. So you can see in the lower part we have the minus sign because we want to make a maximization problem into a minimization problem and we have a sum or the examples because we are taking the logarithm of the likelihood so that we have the log likelihood and then we have the log to the probability and h3 is now our probabilities and our output labels with this passing code.
