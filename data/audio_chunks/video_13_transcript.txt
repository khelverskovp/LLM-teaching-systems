 weight in the first layer and here you can see things get even more complicated because now we actually have to go through two steps of the chain rule. What is very important to notice here is actually that some of the computation we do to get the first derivative with the spectral weights in the single layer and then the first layer are the same. So if we do some bookkeeping we can actually save computation time and this would be more clear if we now go to the general case where we have many hidden units.
