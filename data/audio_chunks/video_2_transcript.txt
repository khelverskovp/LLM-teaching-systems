 minus the log likelihood function. And the likelihood function is defined as the probability of the data we have observed. So in this case, we are doing conditional modeling, so we are not concerned about modeling the input features. We only interested in modeling the outputs given the input. So our likelihood function is probability of Y given X. And this probability we model that the deep model, which has some parameters we call those theta. And the kind of philosophy behind the light.
