 terms kind of the factor of the number of hidden units every time we add a new layer. If you go to next slide where I've kind of highlighted the reuse computation, you can see that actually the same computation, for example, this summation over the outputs is being used in both computing the gradients with spectral weights in the second layer and the first layer. So if we simply store this computation once and for all, then
