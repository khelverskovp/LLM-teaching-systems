 because the actual implementation will not carry out the sum or K. It's kind of wasteful. We'll only use the one, calculate the one term that we are interested in, to do the classification. Yes, so what I already said is that we use gradient descent based learning. So that means we have some training criteria and for example, the likelihood minus the likelihood and then we compute the gradient. So that means that we take the derivative of our cost function, our scalar cost function,
