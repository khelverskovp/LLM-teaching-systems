 and all the units in the second layer. So that means that kind of all the kind of path where the weights in the first layer kind of contribute to the cost in the end. So you can see now that if you put more layers, we'll get more sums and this means that it looks like that actually kind of we cannot go beyond something like this model because we have this kind of exploding complexity where we can't really calculate more and more.
