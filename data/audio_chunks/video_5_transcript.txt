 output label is 0, then we can represent this with a 10-dimensional vector where we have one at the first position and then 0's of the rest and 1, and 1 label 1 we will represent that with a 0, a 1 and then the rest 0's and so on. And now our output of the network as we already find is this softmax, so that means that we each component of this is the probability for each of these 10 classes. And then we can define in the end, so this is exactly the likelihood of the probability, so we can define the cross into picture.
