 we are at so this we index here in this light the iteration number by k and then our learning rate at that iteration is each okay Yes, so let's see how we actually compute these gradients in and deep networks So let's start with the simplest non-trivial networks. So we have a Network which has the has linear outputs in the hidden layer and we have only one hidden layer and we have only one hidden unit and one hidden layer.
