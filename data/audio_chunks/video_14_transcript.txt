 in each layer and now we also add this extra layer in our example. So now we want to take derivatives with respect to the weights in all three layers. And each of the layers have now weights that are matrices. So this is just the M-nist example from before. So now for example, if we want to take derivatives with respect to the weights in the last layer, that's the easiest thing because there we know that okay, the output
